# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model-Text-and-Image-detection-
- The aim of this project it to achieve high accuracy by collecting several data, following the previous 
project and develop those using suitable algorithms, the analysis aims to observe which features are 
most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in 
model selection and hyper parameter selection. 
- The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. 
- To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods and 
neural network classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new 
input and finally we aim to reduce the global death rate of the breast cancer
